# Alvacha
This is a repository for a team for the hackathon Conthrive 2020, which was held from 6th to 8th of March 2020. The team chose a track from Alva, a supplier for water and electricity in the area. The track was "Water usage data analysis and utilizing". We chose the track, because everyone from the team was interested in this track

The data we got was in an Excel file with over 150 000 lines, which was unreadable as it was. We developed a parser for that data, which parses the data into json-form. We used chart.js, an open-source library to draw charts with the data for analysis. The analysis comprised of comparisons between the data of a selected housing to the data of average housing with the intention of finding differences in the data.
